Prep-RC
=======
Prep RC is a server framework built in Java to receive commands from a client which controls an RC car. This project was started after the 2013-2014 AP Computer Science class at St. John's Prep created a function, but less appealing Python alternative. The Java version serves to provide more organized code and a more polished finish application that is separate from the RC car itself.

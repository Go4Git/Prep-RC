Prep-RC
=======
Prep RC is a server framework built in Java to receive commands from a client which controls an RC car. This project was started after the 2013-2014 AP Computer Science class at St. John's Prep created a functioning, but less appealing Python alternative as our final project. The main components of the car are the two Raspberri Pis which run the webcam for live video feed and control the servos and motors on the car itself. Considering we had only two weeks to get the entire project up and running, we frantically scrambled to learn the best way to control the servos and motors on the car. We settled on Python due to the hardware PWM it provided. However, our overall finished product was complicated to use and displayed an ugly UI. The Java version serves to provide a more organized code structure and a more polished user experience that doesn't require directly connecting to the Raspberry Pi.

As of now, the software simply serves as a server to handle communications with the client program. The server program runs on the Raspberry Pi itself, while the client can be opened from any other computer to remotely control the car. The integration for accelerating/turning will either be done via Python scripting or Java (if I can figure out how to achieve hardware PWM with it).
